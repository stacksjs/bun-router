## What is bun-router?

bun-router is a high-performance, feature-rich router designed specifically for Bun applications. Built from the ground up to take advantage of Bun's speed and features, it provides an intuitive and powerful API for handling HTTP routing in your web applications.

## Key Features

- **Fast and Efficient**: Optimized for performance with Bun's native features
- **Complete HTTP Method Support**: Handle GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS, and HEAD requests
- **Advanced Routing**: Path parameters, constraints, groups, and nested routes
- **Middleware Support**: Built-in middleware and easy custom middleware creation
- **WebSocket Integration**: Seamless WebSocket support with pub/sub capabilities
- **Type Safety**: First-class TypeScript support with type inference
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive API that makes development a joy

## Why Choose bun-router?

### Performance

bun-router is built to leverage Bun's speed and efficiency. It integrates directly with Bun's `Bun.serve()` API to provide optimal routing performance without unnecessary overhead.

### Feature Completeness

Whether you're building a simple API or a complex web application, bun-router has the features you need - from basic routing to advanced patterns like domain routing, resource routing, and WebSocket communication.

### Type Safety

With first-class TypeScript support, bun-router provides type safety throughout your application. Route parameters are automatically inferred, and middleware is fully typed.

### Easy to Learn, Hard to Outgrow

bun-router is designed to be easy to get started with, but powerful enough to handle complex routing needs as your application grows.

## Next Steps

Ready to get started? Check out the [Installation Guide](/install) to add bun-router to your project.

# bun-router

This is an opinionated TypeScript Starter kit to help kick-start development of your next Bun package.

## Get Started

It's rather simple to get your package development started:

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
bunx degit stacksjs/bun-router my-pkg
cd my-pkg

 # if you don't have pnpm installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`
bun i # install all deps
bun run build # builds the library for production-ready use

# after you have successfully committed, you may create a "release"
bun run release # automates git commits, versioning, and changelog generations
```

_Check out the package.json scripts for more commands._
